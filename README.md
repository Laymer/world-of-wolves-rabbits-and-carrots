Simulation of the world of wolves, rabbits and carrots
=====

Problem described in the book by Francesco Cesarini.

*As the main exercise for this course, we had to implement a simulated world inhabited by carrots, 
rabbits, and wolves. Rabbits would roam this world eating carrots that grew in ran
om patches. When they had eaten enough carrots, the rabbits would get fat and split in two. 
Wolves ran around eating up the rabbits; if they managed to catch and eat enough rabbits,
they would also get fat and split. Rabbits and wolves within a certain distance of each 
other would broadcast information on food and predators. If a rabbit found a carrot patch, 
other rabbits would quickly join him. If a wolf found a rabbit, the pack would start chasing it.*
